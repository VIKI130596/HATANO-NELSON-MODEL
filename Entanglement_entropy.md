## Entanglement Entropy in Non-Hermitian systems

### Abstract 

Non-Hermitian systems exhibit many novel dynamical behaviors, such as entanglement phase
transitions due to non-Hermitian skin effects. In this work, we delve into the entanglement dynamics
of the non-Hermitian Aubry-AndrÂ´e-Harper (AAH) chain. With the quasiperiodic strength increases,
a transition occurs from area laws induced by the skin effect to area laws arising from Anderson
localization. Two different mechanisms for generating the area law are revealed through early stage
entanglement dynamics. Under the skin effect, the entanglement entropy exhibits a non-monotonic
process, characterized by initial growth, subsequent oscillations, and eventual convergence to a stable
value. In contrast, within the Anderson localization regime, where particle diffusion is absent, the
entanglement entropy remains consistently low. The sharp contrast in the early stage behavior
highlights these two area law regions as distinct phases. Interestingly, at the critical line between
these two regimes of area laws, a volume law emerges. Our study reveals that the area law induced
by the skin effect and the Anderson localization is two different phases, and that a volume law
can emerge at the phase transition point. The understanding of the entanglement phase transition
induced by disorder and skin effect is thus deepened.
