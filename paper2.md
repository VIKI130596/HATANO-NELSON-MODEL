## Paper 2: Winding Numbers, Complex Currents, and Non-Hermitian Localization

### Abstract:

The nature of extended states in disordered tight binding models with a constant imaginary vector
potential is explored. Such models, relevant to vortex physics in superconductors and to population
biology, exhibit a delocalization transition and a band of extended states even for a one-dimensional
ring. Using an analysis of eigenvalue trajectories in the complex plane, we demonstrate that each
delocalized state is characterized by an (integer) winding number, and evaluate the associated complex
current. Winding numbers in higher dimensions are also discussed.
