### PAPER 1: Localization Transitions in Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics
#### Abstract:
We study the localization transitions which arise in both one and two dimensions when quantum
mechanical particles described by a random Schr√∂dinger equation are subjected to a constant imaginary
vector potential. A path-integral formulation relates the transition to flux lines depinned from columnar
defects by a transverse magnetic field in superconductors. The theory predicts that, close to the
depinning transition, the transverse Meissner effect is accompanied by stretched exponential relaxation
of the field into the bulk and a diverging penetration depth.
