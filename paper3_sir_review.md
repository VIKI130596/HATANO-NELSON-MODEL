## Two dimensional lattice with an imaginary magnetic field 

### Abstract:

We explore gauge-independent properties of two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice systems with
an imaginary magnetic field. We find that the energy spectrum under the open boundary conditions
is an example of such gauge-independent properties. We discuss how to obtain the asymptotic
continuum energy spectrum upon increasing length of one side using the framework of the non-Bloch band theory. We also find an analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect; the net change of the
norm of the wavefunction upon adiabatically forming a closed path is determined by the imaginary
magnetic flux enclosed by the path.
