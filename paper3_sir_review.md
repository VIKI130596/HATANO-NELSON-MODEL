## Two dimensional lattice with an imaginary magnetic field 

### Abstract:

We explore gauge-independent properties of two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice systems with
an imaginary magnetic field. We find that the energy spectrum under the open boundary conditions
is an example of such gauge-independent properties. We discuss how to obtain the asymptotic
continuum energy spectrum upon increasing length of one side using the framework of the non-Bloch band theory. We also find an analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect; the net change of the
norm of the wavefunction upon adiabatically forming a closed path is determined by the imaginary
magnetic flux enclosed by the path.

Notes:
  1. Gauge-Independent Properties: Gauge independence means that certain physical properties or observables are not affected by the choice of a gauge. In the context of this study, it implies that certain properties of the system are not dependent on how we choose to describe or mathematically represent the system.
  2. Gauge Symmetry: In physics, gauge symmetry refers to the idea that the physical laws and equations governing a system should remain unchanged (invariant) when certain transformations are applied to the fields or wavefunctions that describe the system. These transformations are known as gauge transformations.
