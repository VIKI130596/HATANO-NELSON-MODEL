## Two dimensional lattice with an imaginary magnetic field 

### Abstract:
 
We explore gauge-independent properties of two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice systems with
an imaginary magnetic field. We find that the energy spectrum under the open boundary conditions
is an example of such gauge-independent properties. We discuss how to obtain the asymptotic
continuum energy spectrum upon increasing length of one side using the framework of the non-Bloch band theory. We also find an analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect; the net change of the
norm of the wavefunction upon adiabatically forming a closed path is determined by the imaginary
magnetic flux enclosed by the path.

Notes:
  1. Gauge-Independent Properties: Gauge independence means that certain physical properties or observables are not affected by the choice of a gauge. In the context of this study, it implies that certain properties of the system are not dependent on how we choose to describe or mathematically represent the system.
  2. Gauge Symmetry: In physics, gauge symmetry refers to the idea that the physical laws and equations governing a system should remain unchanged (invariant) when certain transformations are applied to the fields or wavefunctions that describe the system. These transformations are known as gauge transformations.
  3. Non-Bloch Band Theory:
  4. The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a fascinating quantum mechanical phenomenon that demonstrates the non-locality of quantum physics and the role of the electromagnetic potential in determining the behavior of charged particles. In classical electromagnetism, the motion of a charged particle is influenced by the electric and magnetic fields at its location. These fields are described by the electric field vector (E) and the magnetic field vector (B). In quantum mechanics, the behavior of particles, particularly electrons, is described by wavefunctions. These wavefunctions encode the probability distribution of finding a particle in a particular state or position. In 1959, physicists Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm proposed a thought experiment that demonstrated a quantum effect where the behavior of charged particles is influenced by a magnetic field even in regions where the magnetic field strength is zero.
The thought experiment consists of the following elements:
 
    a. A region where the magnetic field (B) is zero.
    b. A solenoid, a long, thin coil of wire, carrying a magnetic field (B) inside it.
    c. A charged particle, typically an electron, is allowed to move around the solenoid in the zero magnetic field region.
