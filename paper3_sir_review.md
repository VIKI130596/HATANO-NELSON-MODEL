## Two dimensional lattice with an imaginary magnetic field 

### Abstract:
 
We explore gauge-independent properties of two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice systems with
an imaginary magnetic field. We find that the energy spectrum under the open boundary conditions
is an example of such gauge-independent properties. We discuss how to obtain the asymptotic
continuum energy spectrum upon increasing length of one side using the framework of the non-Bloch band theory. We also find an analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect; the net change of the
norm of the wavefunction upon adiabatically forming a closed path is determined by the imaginary
magnetic flux enclosed by the path.

Notes:
  1. Gauge-Independent Properties: Gauge independence means that certain physical properties or observables are not affected by the choice of a gauge. In the context of this study, it implies that certain properties of the system are not dependent on how we choose to describe or mathematically represent the system.
  2. Gauge Symmetry: In physics, gauge symmetry refers to the idea that the physical laws and equations governing a system should remain unchanged (invariant) when certain transformations are applied to the fields or wavefunctions that describe the system. These transformations are known as gauge transformations.
  3. Non-Bloch Band Theory:
  4. The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a fascinating quantum mechanical phenomenon that demonstrates the non-locality of quantum physics and the role of the electromagnetic potential in determining the behavior of charged particles. In classical electromagnetism, the motion of a charged particle is influenced by the electric and magnetic fields at its location. These fields are described by the electric field vector (E) and the magnetic field vector (B). In quantum mechanics, the behavior of particles, particularly electrons, is described by wavefunctions. These wavefunctions encode the probability distribution of finding a particle in a particular state or position. In 1959, physicists Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm proposed a thought experiment that demonstrated a quantum effect where the behavior of charged particles is influenced by a magnetic field even in regions where the magnetic field strength is zero.
The thought experiment consists of the following elements:
 
    a. A region where the magnetic field (B) is zero.
    b. A solenoid, a long, thin coil of wire, carrying a magnetic field (B) inside it.
    c. A charged particle, typically an electron, is allowed to move around the solenoid in the zero magnetic field region.

The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where the phase of a quantum wavefunction changes when the particle enclosed by a closed path is subjected to a magnetic field, even if the particle itself does not experience the magnetic force directly.The study finds an analog of this effect in the non-Hermitian lattice system, where the change in the norm (magnitude) of the wavefunction (a measure of its probability) is related to the imaginary magnetic flux enclosed by a path.

 1. Landau Level: A Landau level is a term used in condensed matter physics to describe the quantized energy levels of charged particles, typically electrons, in a two-dimensional system subjected to a magnetic field. Landau levels are a fundamental concept in understanding the behavior of electrons in a magnetic field, especially in the context of the quantum Hall effect and topological insulators. In a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to a two-dimensional (2D) plane, the energy levels of electrons become quantized. This means that electrons can only occupy specific discrete energy levels, and they cannot have just any energy value. Landau levels originate from the quantization of the kinetic energy of electrons in a magnetic field. The magnetic field exerts a force on the moving electrons, causing them to follow curved trajectories, known as cyclotron orbits. As a consequence of these curved orbits, the kinetic energy of the electrons becomes quantized. This quantization leads to the formation of Landau levels, each corresponding to a different energy state. Landau levels are characterized by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number (n) and the magnetic quantum number (m).

        The principal quantum number (n) represents the Landau level index and determines the energy level. Higher values of n correspond to higher energy levels.
        The magnetic quantum number (m) determines the orientation of the electron's orbit within a Landau level. It can take integer values ranging from -n to +n. 

The energy levels in a Landau level system are equidistant and increase linearly with the Landau level index (n). The energy spacing between adjacent Landau levels is determined by the strength of the magnetic field. Landau levels play a crucial role in understanding phenomena like the quantum Hall effect, which is a quantum mechanical phenomenon observed in 2D electron systems subjected to a strong magnetic field and low temperatures. The quantization of conductance in the quantum Hall effect is intimately connected to the Landau levels.

    How Landau Levels can explain the Quantum Hall Effect?

The Quantum Hall Effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon observed in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to a strong magnetic field and low temperatures.
 1. Energy Quantization: In the presence of a magnetic field, electrons in a 2D system move in circular orbits due to the Lorentz force. The kinetic energy of these electrons is quantized into discrete levels called Landau levels. The energy spacing between these levels is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.
 2. Landau Levels and Conductance: At absolute zero temperature, electrons in a 2D system will occupy the lowest energy Landau level, known as the ground state. As the magnetic field strength increases, the energy gap between Landau levels widens. The quantization of the Hall conductance (σ_xy) arises from the quantization of the number of filled Landau levels. Specifically, the Hall conductance is given by σ_xy = νe^2/h, where ν is the filling factor and h is Planck's constant. The filling factor represents the ratio of the electron density to the number of available Landau levels. The QHE occurs when the filling factor takes on integer values (ν = 1, 2, 3, ...) or fractional values (ν = 1/3, 2/5, ...), resulting in plateaus in the Hall conductance as the magnetic field strength is varied.
 3. Plateaus in Conductance: These quantized Hall plateaus are robust against disorder and imperfections in the material, making them exceptionally accurate standards of resistance.
