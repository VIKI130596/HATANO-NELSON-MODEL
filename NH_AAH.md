## Phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Harper model 

### Abstract 
The Aubry-André-Harper model provides a paradigmatic example of aperiodic order in a one-dimensional
lattice displaying a delocalization-localization phase transition at a finite critical value Vc of the quasiperiodic
potential amplitude V . In terms of the dynamical behavior of the system, the phase transition is discontinuous
when one measures the quantum diffusion exponent δ of wave-packet spreading, with δ = 1 in the delocalized
phase V < Vc (ballistic transport), δ  1/2 at the critical point V = Vc (diffusive transport), and δ = 0 in the
localized phase V > Vc (dynamical localization). However, the phase transition turns out to be smooth when one
measures, as a dynamical variable, the speed v(V ) of excitation transport in the lattice, which is a continuous
function of potential amplitude V and vanishes as the localized phase is approached. Here we consider a nonHermitian 
extension of the Aubry-André-Harper model, in which hopping along the lattice is asymmetric, and
show that the dynamical localization-delocalization transition is discontinuous, not only in the diffusion exponent
δ, but also in the speed v of ballistic transport. This means that even very close to the spectral phase transition
point, rather counterintuitively, ballistic transport with a finite speed is allowed in the lattice. Also, we show that
the ballistic velocity can increase as V is increased above zero, i.e., surprisingly, disorder in the lattice can result
in an enhancement of transport.
